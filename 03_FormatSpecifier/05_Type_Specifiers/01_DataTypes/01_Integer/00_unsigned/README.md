# C Program: UnSigned_Int_Example

This is a simple C program that demonstrates the use of an `unsigned int` variable to represent the number of students in a classroom. It also includes a `printf` statement to display the value of the `unsigned int` variable.

## Program Details

- The program declares an `unsigned int` variable named `numberOfStudents`.
- A value of 150 is assigned to the `numberOfStudents` variable, which represents the number of students in the classroom.
- The program uses the `printf` function to display a message along with the value of `numberOfStudents`. It utilizes the `%u` format specifier to indicate that the variable is an unsigned integer.

## Running the Program

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).
2. Save the program to a file with a `.c` extension (e.g., `UnSignedIntStudentsCount.c`).
3. Compile the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   gcc UnSignedIntStudentsCount.c -o UnSignedIntStudentsCount
