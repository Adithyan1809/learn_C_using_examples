# Keywords in C Programming

Keywords in C programming are reserved words that have predefined meanings and functionalities in the C language. 
They are an essential part of the language's syntax and structure, playing specific roles in defining data types, control flow, and more.

## What Are Keywords?

Keywords are words that are reserved by the C language for specific purposes. They cannot be used as identifiers (variable, function, or label names) because they have special meanings in the language. Attempting to use a keyword as an identifier will result in a compilation error.

## Common C Keywords

C has a set of common keywords that serve various purposes in the language. Some of the most frequently used keywords include:

- **Data Type Keywords:** These keywords define the type of data a variable can hold. Examples include `int`, `char`, `float`, and `double`.

- **Control Structure Keywords:** These keywords control the flow of program execution, enabling tasks such as decision-making and looping. Examples include `if`, `else`, `for`, and `while`.

- **Storage Class Keywords:** These keywords specify the storage duration and scope of variables. Examples include `auto`, `static`, and `extern`.

- **Constant Keywords:** These keywords are used to work with constants. `const` and `enum` are common examples.

- **Data Type Modifiers:** These keywords modify data types for specific use cases. Examples include `typedef`, `struct`, and `union`.

- **Function Declaration Keywords:** The `return` keyword is used to indicate the value a function should return.

- **Special Keywords:** Keywords like `sizeof` and `volatile` have unique roles and functionalities.
