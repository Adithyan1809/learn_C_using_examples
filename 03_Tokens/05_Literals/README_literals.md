# Literals in C Programming

In C programming, a literal is a constant value that is directly written into the code. It represents a fixed value of a specific data type, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, or strings.

Literals are essential in programming as they provide fixed, unchanging values for use in calculations, assignments, and comparisons in a program.

## Examples

### Integer Literal

An integer literal is a constant value of the integer data type. It can be written directly in the code.

Example:
```c
int myNumber = 42;

### Floating-Point Literal
A floating-point literal represents a constant value of the floating-point data type (e.g., float or double).

```c
float piValue = 3.14;

### Character Literal
A character literal represents a constant value of the character data type. It is enclosed in single quotes.

```c
char myChar = 'A';

### String Literal
A string literal represents a constant value of the string data type. It is a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.

```c
char greeting[] = "Hello, World!";
