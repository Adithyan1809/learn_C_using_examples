    Purpose: Demonstrate the concept of identifiers in C.

    Description:
        Identifiers are user-defined names given to various program elements such as variables, functions, arrays, etc.
        They play a crucial role in recognizing and accessing program elements.

        Rules for valid C identifiers:
        - They must start with a letter (uppercase (A-Z) or lowercase (a-z)) or an underscore (_).
        - Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, or underscores.
        - Cannot be a C keyword (reserved word).
        - Are case-sensitive, meaning myVariable and myvariable are different identifiers.

        Examples:
        - Variable Identifier: int age;
        - Function Identifier: void printMessage() { /* ... */ }
        - Label Identifier (used with goto): myLabel:
