# Floating Point Temperature

## Description

This C program, "FloatingPointTemperature.c," illustrates the use of float variables with varying precision and format specifiers. It declares three float variables: `temperatureFloatWithF`, which is explicitly defined as a float using the 'f' suffix; `temperatureFloatWithoutF`, a float by default; and `priceFloat`, which demonstrates more decimal places for precision. The program uses `printf` statements to display these variables with both default and specified precisions, including examples of 2 and 7 decimal places. This program serves as a practical guide for formatting and presenting floating-point numbers in C, offering insight into precision control and format specifiers for float data types.

## Program Usage

1. Compile the program using a C compiler:
   ```bash
   gcc FloatingPointTemperature.c -o FloatingPointTemperature

2. Run the compiled program
    ```bash
   ./FloatingPointTemperature

The program will display the values of the float variables with different precisions to demonstrate how format specifiers affect the output.
