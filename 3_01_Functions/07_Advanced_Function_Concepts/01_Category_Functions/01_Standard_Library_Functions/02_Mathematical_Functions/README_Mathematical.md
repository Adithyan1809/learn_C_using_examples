# Mathematical Functions in C

This README provides an overview of Mathematical functions in the C programming language.

## Functions
- `sqrt()`, `abs()`, `pow()`: Basic mathematical operations.
- `floor()`, `ceil()`: Rounding functions.
- `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`: Trigonometric functions.

## Header File
To use these functions in your C programs, include the following header file:

```c
#include <math.h>
```
