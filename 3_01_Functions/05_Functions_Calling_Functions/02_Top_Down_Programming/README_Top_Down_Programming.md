# Top-Down Programming

Top-down programming refers to breaking down a problem into smaller tasks, implementing each task as a function, and then composing them to solve the overall problem.

## Explanation

It provides a clear structure for problem-solving by breaking down the problem into smaller, more manageable tasks. This approach makes implementation more manageable and simplifies debugging by focusing on smaller, independent functions.

## Benefits

- **Clear Structure:** Breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks.
- **Ease of Implementation:** Focus on solving smaller parts independently.
- **Simplified Debugging:** Identifying and fixing issues in smaller, modular functions.

## Illustration

Consider solving a complex mathematical problem. Break it into steps like input validation, computation, and result display. Each step can be implemented as a separate function.
