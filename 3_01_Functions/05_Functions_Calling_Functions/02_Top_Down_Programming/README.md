# Code Structure

## Functions Utilized:
- **validateInput:** Checks if the user-provided input is non-negative.
- **calculateSquare:** Calculates the square of a given number.
- **displayResult:** Displays the result of the square calculation.

## Implementation Steps:
1. **User Input Validation:** The program begins by prompting the user to input a non-negative number.
2. **Validation Function:** `validateInput` ensures the user-provided value is non-negative, adhering to the defined criteria.
3. **Square Calculation:** If the input passes validation, `calculateSquare` computes the square of the number.
4. **Result Display:** The `displayResult` function presents the calculated square to the user.

## Advantages of Top-Down Approach
- **Clear Structure:** The problem-solving process is divided into distinct steps, simplifying comprehension and code maintenance.
- **Modularity:** Each function encapsulates a specific task, promoting code reusability and easier testing.
- **Debugging Ease:** Isolating functions aids in pinpointing and resolving errors in smaller, manageable sections of code.

## Conclusion
This example highlights the top-down programming methodology by compartmentalizing a larger problem into smaller, well-defined functions. The structured approach enhances readability, simplifies implementation, and facilitates effective debugging.
