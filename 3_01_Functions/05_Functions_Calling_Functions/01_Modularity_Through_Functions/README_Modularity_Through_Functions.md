# Modularity Through Functions

Functions in programming encapsulate a set of instructions that perform a specific task. They enable breaking down a program into smaller, reusable parts, enhancing code organization and maintainability.

## Importance

- **Code Reusability:** Functions can be called multiple times, promoting reuse of code segments.
- **Readability:** They make code more readable by abstracting complex logic into smaller, manageable units.
- **Maintenance:** Changes or bug fixes can be localized to specific functions, reducing the impact on the entire program.

## Example

Consider the calculation of factorial using a function `factorial()`. This function accepts an integer and recursively calculates its factorial, showcasing the power of encapsulation.
