# Local and Global Variables in C

- In C programming, variables can be categorized into two main types: 
    - local variables and 
    - global variables. 
- Understanding the differences between these variables is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable code.

## Local Variables

- Local variables are declared within a specific block of code, such as inside a function or a compound statement. 
- They have limited scope and are accessible only within the block where they are defined. 
- Once the block execution is over, the memory allocated to these variables is released.

## Global Variables
- Global variables are declared outside of any function, usually at the beginning of the program. 
- They have a larger scope compared to local variables and 
- Global variables can be accessed and modified from any part of the program. 
- Global variables retain their value throughout the program's execution.
