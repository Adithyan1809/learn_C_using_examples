# Types of Functions in C Programming

Functions in C programming serve as essential building blocks, offering diverse capabilities and characteristics. Here are the different types of functions:

## Standard Library Functions

**Description:** Predefined functions provided by the C standard library.
- **Examples:** `printf()`, `scanf()`, `strlen()`, etc.
  
## User-Defined Functions

**Description:** Functions defined by the programmer to perform specific tasks.
- **Void Functions:** Functions that do not return a value.
- **Non-Void Functions:** Functions that return a value.
- **Recursive Functions:** Functions that call themselves either directly or indirectly.
- **Parameterized Functions:** Functions that accept parameters/arguments.
- **Non-Parameterized Functions:** Functions that do not accept any parameters.
- **Inline Functions:** Functions with code substituted at the point of function call for performance.

## Library Functions

**Description:** Functions from external libraries offering specialized functionalities.
- **Standard C Library Functions:** Functions from standard headers like `<stdio.h>`, `<math.h>`, etc.
- **Third-Party Libraries:** Functions from external libraries catering to specific needs.

## Callback Functions

**Description:** Functions passed as arguments to other functions for customization.
- Allows flexible behavior and customization of certain operations.

## Lambda Functions (C11 onwards)

**Description:** Anonymous functions used as arguments to higher-order functions.
- Improves code readability and maintainability.

## Pointer to Functions

**Description:** Functions accessed through pointers, enabling dynamic invocation.
- Allows for the implementation of function pointers.

These different types of functions in C offer diverse functionalities and characteristics, providing flexibility, modularity, and customization to the codebase. They cater to various programming needs, from standard operations to advanced and specialized functionalities.
