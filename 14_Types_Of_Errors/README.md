# Types of Errors in C Language

C programming can be prone to different types of errors, which can be classified as follows:

## 1. Compile-Time Errors

Compile-time errors are detected during the compilation phase of a C program. They are related to the program's syntax, data types, and structure. Common examples include:
- Syntax errors
- Missing semicolons
- Undefined variables
- Incorrect function calls

Compile-time errors prevent the program from being successfully compiled and result in error messages.

## 2. Run-Time Errors

Run-time errors occur during the execution of a C program. These errors are typically associated with issues like:
- Invalid input data
- Division by zero
- Null pointer dereferencing
- Array index out of bounds
- Memory allocation failures

Run-time errors can lead to program termination or produce unexpected results, and they require careful handling.

## 3. Logical Errors

Logical errors, also known as semantic errors, are subtle issues that do not cause immediate crashes or compile-time errors. Instead, they lead to incorrect program behavior. Common sources of logical errors include:
- Incorrect program logic
- Flawed algorithm design
- Wrong assumptions about program behavior
- Incorrect data processing

Debugging logical errors can be challenging because they do not generate error messages but affect the program's correctness.

Understanding these types of errors and learning effective debugging techniques is essential for developing reliable C programs.
