# C Program: Demonstrating the Use of `long long` Data Type

- **Program Name**: LongLongIntWorldPopulation.c
- **Author**: Vidyadhar Bendre
- **Email**: vidyadhar.bendre@gmail.com

## Description

In this example:

- `indiaGDPWithoutLL` represents the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of India without using the `LL` suffix.
- `totalRainfall` represents the total annual rainfall in India in millimeters using the `LL` suffix.
- `indiaGDPWithLL` represents the GDP of India with the `LL` suffix.

This program demonstrates the importance of using `LL` with `long long` when working with values that exceed the range of a regular `int` and provides an Indian context that people can relate to.

## Running the Program

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).
2. Save the program to a file with a `.c` extension (e.g., `LongLongIntWorldPopulation.c`).
3. Compile the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   gcc LongLongIntWorldPopulation.c -o LongLongIntWorldPopulation

1. Run the compiled program

   ```bash
./LongLongIntWorldPopulation

You will see the values of the variables displayed with appropriate descriptions, demonstrating the use of long long data types in an Indian context.
