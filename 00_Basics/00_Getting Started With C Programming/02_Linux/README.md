## Opening a Terminal
To work with Linux, open a terminal or command-line interface. On most Linux distributions, press `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T` to open a terminal window.

## Navigating Directories
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `ls`: List files and directories in the current directory.
- `cd`: Change the current directory.

## Creating and Managing Directories
- `mkdir <directory_name>`: Create a new directory.
- `rmdir <directory_name>` or `rm -r <directory_name>`: Remove a directory (empty).

## Creating and Editing Files
- `touch <filename>`: Create an empty file.
- Use text editors like `nano`, `vim`, or `gedit` to edit files.
- `cat <filename>`: Display the content of a file.

## Compiling and Running C Programs
- To compile a C program: `gcc <source_file.c> -o <output_program>`
- To run a compiled program: `./<output_program>`

## File and Directory Manipulation
- `cp <source> <destination>`: Copy files or directories.
- `mv <source> <destination>`: Move or rename files or directories.
- `rm <file>`: Remove a file.

## Permissions
- Use `chmod` and `chown` to change file permissions and ownership.

## Archiving and Compression
- Use `tar` to create and extract tar archives.
- Use `gzip` and `gunzip` for file compression.

## Viewing Help and Manuals
- `man <command>`: Display manual pages for commands.
- `--help` or `-h` with a command for command-specific help.

## Internet and Networking
- Use commands like `ping`, `ifconfig`, and `ssh` for network-related tasks.

## Monitoring and System Information
- Use commands like `top`, `ps`, `df`, and `du` for system monitoring and information.

## Pipes and Redirection
- Use `|`, `>`, `>>`, and `<` for working with input and output.

## Exit and Logout
- Use `exit` or `logout` to exit the terminal or log out.

These basic Linux commands are essential for C programming on a Linux system. As you become more familiar with Linux, you can explore more advanced commands and concepts.
