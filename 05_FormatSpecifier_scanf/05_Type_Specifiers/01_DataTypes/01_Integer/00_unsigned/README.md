# C Program: UnSigned_Int_Example

## Purpose and Description

This is a simple C program that demonstrates the use of an `unsigned int` variable to represent the number of students in a classroom. It also includes `scanf` and `printf` statements to accept and display the value of the `unsigned int` variable. The program showcases working with unsigned integer data types, handling user input, and displaying information in a C program.

## Program Details

- The program declares an `unsigned int` variable named `numberOfStudents`.
- It prompts the user to enter the number of students and reads the input into the `numberOfStudents` variable using `scanf`.
- The program uses the `printf` function to display the entered value with an appropriate message using the `%u` format specifier to indicate that the variable is an unsigned integer.

## Running the Program

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).
2. Save the program to a file with a `.c` extension (e.g., `UnSignedIntStudentsCount.c`).
3. Compile the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   gcc UnSignedIntStudentsCount.c -o UnSignedIntStudentsCount

4. Run the compiled program
   ```bash
   ./UnSignedIntStudentsCount
