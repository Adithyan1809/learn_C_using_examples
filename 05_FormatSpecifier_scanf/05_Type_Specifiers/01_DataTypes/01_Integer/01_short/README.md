# C Program: Short Integer Example (Temperature)

This is a C program that demonstrates the use of a `short int` variable to represent the current temperature in degrees Celsius. The program incorporates both `printf` and `scanf` statements to display and accept temperature and `questionMark` values.

## Program Details

- The program declares `short int` variables for `temperature` and `questionMark`.
- The user is prompted to enter the current temperature in degrees Celsius and a value for `questionMark`.
- The program uses the `scanf` function to accept these values from the user.
- It then displays the accepted values with appropriate messages using `printf` statements. The `%hd` format specifier is used for `temperature` and `questionMark`, and the `%c` format specifier is used to display `questionMark` as a character.

## Running the Program

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).
2. Save the program to a file with a `.c` extension (e.g., `ShortIntTempertureInCelsius.c`).
3. Compile the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   gcc ShortIntTempertureInCelsius.c -o ShortIntTempertureInCelsius

4. Run the compiled program
   ```bash
   ./ShortIntTempertureInCelsius
