# Array Definition

An array in programming represents a sequential or contiguous collection of elements, all sharing the same data type. It offers a structured way to store and organize multiple values under a single name. Each element within an array is accessed using its index or ordinal position, allowing for efficient manipulation and retrieval of specific data.

### Key Attributes:

- **Homogeneous Elements:** Arrays consist of elements of the same data type, ensuring uniformity within the collection.
- **Sequential Storage:** Elements are stored in a sequential or contiguous manner in memory, facilitating easy access through indices.
- **Index-Based Access:** Accessing individual elements is done by referring to their unique index, starting from 0 in most programming languages.
- **Ordered Collection:** Maintains an order or sequence of elements, retaining the arrangement in which they were stored.

### Purpose:

Arrays serve as fundamental data structures, enabling the handling of related data in an organized and structured format. They provide a convenient way to manage and process multiple values efficiently within a program.
