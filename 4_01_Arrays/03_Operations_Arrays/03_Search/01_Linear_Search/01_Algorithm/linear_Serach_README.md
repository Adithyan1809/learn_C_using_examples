### Linear Search Algorithm Steps

1. **Input:**
   - An array of elements.
   - Target element to search.
   - Start from the first element in the array.

2. **Compare:**
   - Compare each element of the array with the target element.
   - If a match is found:
     - Return the index of the element where the match occurs.
   - If no match is found after checking all elements:
     - Return -1 to indicate that the target element is not present in the array.
   - Repeat the process until the end of the array is reached.
