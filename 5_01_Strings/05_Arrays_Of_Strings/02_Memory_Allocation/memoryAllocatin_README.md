# Memory Allocation for Arrays of Strings in C

In C programming, memory allocation for arrays of strings can be handled using either a two-dimensional array or an array of pointers to strings. Each approach has its advantages and is suitable for different scenarios.

## Two-Dimensional Array (Array of Characters)

A two-dimensional array is a contiguous block of memory used to store multiple strings, with each element being a character array (string).

### Example

```c
#define MAX_STRINGS 10
#define MAX_LENGTH 20

char strings[MAX_STRINGS][MAX_LENGTH];
```

- **MAX_STRINGS:** Maximum number of strings.
- **MAX_LENGTH:** Maximum length of each string.

## Memory Layout

```scss
strings[0] -> [ ][ ][ ][ ]...[ ] (String 0)
strings[1] -> [ ][ ][ ][ ]...[ ] (String 1)
...
strings[N] -> [ ][ ][ ][ ]...[ ] (String N)
```
