# Array of Strings in C

An array of strings in C represents a collection of strings stored in a two-dimensional array structure. Each element in the array holds a string, which is an array of characters terminated by a null character (`'\0'`).

## Overview

In C, strings are arrays of characters. An array of strings is essentially an array where each element is a string itself.

### Example

Consider the following example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Declaration and initialization of an array of strings
    char strings[][20] = {
        "Hello",
        "World",
        "Programming",
        "In",
        "C"
    };

    // Accessing elements of the array of strings
    printf("%s\n", strings[0]); // Output: Hello
    printf("%s\n", strings[1]); // Output: World
    // ... (prints other strings)

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, char strings[][20] declares an array of strings where each string can hold up to 19 characters plus the null terminator ('\0'). It demonstrates how to initialize and access elements within the array of strings.

## Usage

- **Declaration:** char strings[][size] declares an array of strings.
- **Initialization:** Initialize the array with strings or assign strings to its elements.
- **Access:** Access individual strings using array indices (strings[0], strings[1], etc.).
- **Manipulation:** Modify or process strings within the array using standard string manipulation techniques.

Arrays of strings are commonly used to handle multiple strings, such as storing a list of words, lines from a file, or command-line arguments.
