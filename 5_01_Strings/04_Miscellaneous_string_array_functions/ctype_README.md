# Ctype.h Functionality

The `ctype.h` header file in C provides functions for character classification and conversion.

## Character Classification Functions

- `isalpha`: Checks if a character is an alphabet (a-z, A-Z).
- `isdigit`: Checks if a character is a digit (0-9).
- `isalnum`: Checks if a character is an alphanumeric character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9).
- `isspace`: Checks if a character is a white-space character (space, tab, newline, etc.).
- `islower`, `isupper`: Checks if a character is lowercase or uppercase.
- `ispunct`: Checks if a character is a punctuation symbol.
- `iscntrl`: Checks if a character is a control character.

## Character Conversion Functions

- `tolower`: Converts an uppercase character to its lowercase equivalent.
- `toupper`: Converts a lowercase character to its uppercase equivalent.

These functions are particularly useful for character-based operations, input validation, and manipulation tasks in C programming.
