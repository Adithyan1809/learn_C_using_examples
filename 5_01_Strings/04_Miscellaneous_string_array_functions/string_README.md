# String.h Functionality

The `string.h` header file in C provides functions for string manipulation.

## String Copy and Concatenation

- `strcpy`: Copies a string from source to destination.
- `strncpy`: Copies a specific number of characters from source to destination.
- `strcat`: Concatenates (appends) one string to the end of another.
- `strncat`: Concatenates a specific number of characters from one string to another.

## String Comparison

- `strcmp`: Compares two strings lexicographically.
- `strncmp`: Compares a specific number of characters of two strings.

## String Length

- `strlen`: Returns the length of a string (the number of characters in the string).

## String Search

- `strstr`: Finds the first occurrence of a substring within a string.
- `strchr`, `strrchr`: Locate the first or last occurrence of a character in a string.
- `strpbrk`: Finds the first occurrence of any character in a specified set.

## String Manipulation

- `memset`: Fills a block of memory with a specified value.
- `memcpy`: Copies a block of memory from source to destination.

These functions are crucial for manipulating strings, performing comparisons, searches, and other string-related operations in C programming.
