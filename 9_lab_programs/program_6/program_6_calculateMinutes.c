Implement a C program to read values from the user for todayâ€™s date and your date of birth
in the format dd-mm-yyyy. 

Assume a sleeping time of 8 hours a day, reading time of 12 hours, and spending 1.5 hours
a day for eating. 

Calculate the total minutes you have spent as of this date for sleeping and eating. 

Determine the number of years you have spent reading as of this date 
(amount of time spent reading in years).
