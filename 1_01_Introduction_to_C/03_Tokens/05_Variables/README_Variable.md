# Understanding Variables in C

In C programming, variables are fundamental elements used to store and manipulate data. Variables act as named storage locations in memory, allowing you to work with different types of information in your programs.

## Declaring Variables

In C, declaring a variable involves specifying its name and data type. Common data types for variables in C include `int`, `float`, `char`, `double`, and more. Here's a simple variable declaration:


### Variable Declaration Syntax
```c
Data_Type Identifier = literal;

```c
int age = 40; // Declaring an integer variable named 'age'

Examples
Declare an integer variable 'age' and assign it the value 40.
Declare a floating-point variable 'pi' and assign it the value 3.14.
Declare a character variable 'myGrade' and assign it the grade 'A'.
Print the values of these variables using the printf function.

Tokenization
Variable: age, pi, myGrade
Data Type: int, float, char
Identifier: age, pi, myGrade
Assignment Operator: =
Literal: 40, 3.14, 'A'
