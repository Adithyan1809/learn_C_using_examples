## Purpose

This program determines whether an entered integer is an even or an odd number using the modulus operator in C.

## Description

- The program prompts the user to enter an integer.
- It utilizes the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder when the entered number is divided by 2.
- If the remainder is 0, the program identifies the number as even; otherwise, it classifies it as odd.
- The program then displays the result, confirming whether the entered number is even or odd.

## Running the Program

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).
2. Save the program to a file with a .c extension (e.g., EvenOrOdd.c).
3. Compile the program using the following command:

    ```bash
    gcc checkEvenOdd.c -o checkEvenOdd
4. Run the compiled program
    ```bash
    ./checkEvenOdd

The program will prompt you to enter an integer, and it will determine and display whether the entered number is even or odd.
