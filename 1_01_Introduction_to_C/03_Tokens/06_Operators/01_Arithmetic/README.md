# C Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators in C are symbols or special characters used to perform various mathematical operations on operands, such as variables, constants, or expressions. 

Expression: An expression is a combination of variables, constants, and operators that, when evaluated, produces a value.

These operators allow you to carry out fundamental mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and finding remainders. They are essential in numerical computations and play a critical role in many C programs.

Here are the primary arithmetic operators in C:

**Addition (+):** The addition operator is represented by the plus symbol (+) and is used to add two or more values together.

Example: int sum = 5 + 3; (The sum variable will contain the value 8.)

**Subtraction (-):** The subtraction operator is represented by the minus symbol (-) and is used to subtract one value from another.

Example: int difference = 10 - 4; (The difference variable will contain the value 6.)

**Multiplication (*):** The multiplication operator is represented by an asterisk (*) and is used to multiply two values.

Example: int product = 6 * 9; (The product variable will contain the value 54.)

**Division (/):** The division operator is represented by a forward slash (/) and is used to divide one value by another.

Example: int quotient = 20 / 5; (The quotient variable will contain the value 4.)

**Modulus (%):** The modulus operator is represented by the percent symbol (%) and is used to find the remainder when one value is divided by another.

Example: int remainder = 11 % 3; (The remainder variable will contain the value 2, which is the remainder of the division.)
