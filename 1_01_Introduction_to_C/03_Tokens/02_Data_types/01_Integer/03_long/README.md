# C Program: Demonstrating the Use of `long` Data Type

- **Program Name**: longIntIndiaPopulation.c
- **Author**: Vidyadhar Bendre
- **Email**: vidyadhar.bendre@gmail.com

## Description

In this example, we have declared a `long` variable named `indiaPopulation`, which represents the estimated population of India in the year 2023. When we use the `%ld` format specifier in the `printf` statement, it tells the program to print a `long` integer, matching the data type of the `indiaPopulation` variable. The output will display the population of India in 2023 as a `long` integer.

### Scenario 1: India's Population

- `indiaPopulationWithoutL` and `indiaPopulationWithL` demonstrate the use of `long` for India's population, one without and one with the `L` suffix.

### Scenario 2: Estimated Number of Stars

- `populationOfStars` demonstrates the use of `long` with the `L` suffix for the estimated number of stars in a galaxy.

This example illustrates how to use `long` with and without the `L` suffix for different scenarios where the size of the integer literal and data type declaration matters.

## Running the Program

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).
2. Save the program to a file with a `.c` extension (e.g., `longIntIndiaPopulation.c`).
3. Compile the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   gcc longIntIndiaPopulation.c -o long_data_type


1. Run the compiled program:

   ```bash
   ./longIntIndiaPopulation

"The population of India in 2023 is 1,380,004,385" displayed in your terminal, representing India's population in the specified year.
