# C Program: Demonstrating Data Types, `scanf`, and `printf` with `long` Data Type

## Description

This program serves as a practical example of how to work with data types in C, specifically focusing on the `long` data type. It declares three `long` variables to represent population figures and effectively demonstrates the use of data type specifiers, `scanf` for user input, and `printf` for output.

In this program:

- 'indiaPopulationWithoutL' and 'indiaPopulationWithL' represent India's population, one without and one with the 'L' suffix.
- 'populationOfStars' demonstrates the use of `long` integers for the estimated number of stars in a galaxy.

This example showcases:

1. The role of data types in variable declarations.
2. Accepting user input using `scanf` with `%ld` data type specifiers.
3. Displaying variables using `printf` with `%ld` data type specifiers.

Learn how to work with data types effectively and see how user input and program output are managed in C.

## Running the Program

1. Ensure you have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., GCC).
2. Save the program to a file with a `.c` extension (e.g., `longIntIndiaPopulation.c`).
3. Compile the program using the following command:

   ```bash
   gcc longIntIndiaPopulation.c -o long_data_type

4. Run the compiled program

   ```bash
   ./LongIntIndiapopulation

The program will prompt you to enter values for India's population and the estimated number of stars in a galaxy. Observe the proper use of data type specifiers, scanf, and printf to handle user input and display output effectively. This is a valuable exercise in understanding data types and input/output operations in C programming.
